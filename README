 @section Autobuild_Introduction Introduction

The autobuild tools are a set of perl scripts, perl modules and
XML configuration files to automatically build our projects (ACE+TAO)
on multiple platforms.  The tools run on Unix (several flavors) and
Windows NT/2k/XP.

They clearly need more documentation, but it is fairly easy to guess
how another build can be added or how to change the configuration for
a build.
