Wed May 15 17:02:47 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/beguine/Redhat_7.1_No_AMI_Messaging.xml:
	  Run MINIMUM tests.

Sun May 12 16:01:35 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	  Full build.

Sun May 12 15:50:39 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/beguine/Redhat_7.1_Core.xml: Renamed it as a
	  Full build. This build is not a core build. 

	* configs/autobuild/beguine/Redhat_7.1_Full.xml: A full build on
	  beguine.doc. 

	* configs/autobuild/beguine/driver.sh: Start the right build.

Sun May 12 15:41:29 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/beguine/Redhat_7.1_No_AMI_Messaging.xml: Do
	  not run the tests. There is no point in running the test since
	  most of the test depends on some policy. We can run the test if
	  we have a seperate build list created. Till then..

Thu May  9 19:55:34 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	  of the scoreboard since the compiler is busted. 

	* configs/autobuild/danzon/SunOS_SunCC53.xml: New build in places
	  of CC51. SSL has been disabled for the timebeing. Need to see
	  how to run egd for that. My guess is that it should be started
	  in driver.sh. Once this build settles down will do that.

	* configs/autobuild/danzon/driver.sh: Changed the compiler that
	  needs to be used.

Thu May  9 22:27:26 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/beguine/*: Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/local/lib
	  comes first.  This is necessary to pick up the version of libstdc++ that
	  comes with gcc 2.95.3 which is installed in /usr/local/lib.

Wed May  8 23:02:44 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	  Fixed LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting.

Mon Dec 17 16:17:28 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* command/cvs.pm:
	* command/sam.pm:
	* command/auto_run_tests.pm:
	* command/printaceconfig.pm:
	* command/process_logs.pm:
	  Consistently use the 'root' variable for the directory
	  immediately above ACE_wrappers (or whatever the project name
	  is).
	  Used (!-d || !-r) to detect if a directory is both readable and
	  really a directory.

	* command/log.pm:
	* command/process_logs.pm:
	  Fixed inconsistencies in the management of the log_file
	  variable, for log.pm it could be an absolute path, for
	  process_logs.pm it needed to be a relatively path.  Now it is
	  always relative.

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/driver.sh:
	  Removed dead code. Dump autobuild.pl output to /dev/null, only
	  used when debugging.

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/Core.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/ringil/Test.xml:
	  Adjusted all XML files to the new variables, including changes
	  in semantics.

Mon Dec 17 10:48:46 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/Core.xml:
	  Run the move, prettify and clean stuff in a single command.

Sun Dec 16 06:00:42 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/driver.sh:
	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/Core.xml:
	  Use process_logs to install the logs.

Sat Dec 15 09:22:33 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/driver.sh:
	  Minor changes to make debugging easier.

Fri Dec 14 11:16:12 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* make_pretty.pl (makefile_compiler_output):
	  In print_summary(): use $_ only if it is defined.

Wed Dec 12 17:31:19 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/driver.sh:
	  Changed the build to use gcc-3.0.2 because the compiler on this
	  platform is busted.

Wed Dec 12 16:03:35 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/driver.sh:
	  Fixed -i options.

Wed Dec 12 09:27:49 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* command/log.pm:
	  Remove unused access to a variable.

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/Core.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/driver.sh:
	  Add configuration files for a Core build on maedhros.ece.uci.edu

Tue Dec 11 11:05:16 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* command/make.pm:
	  Use open() instead of `` to run the subprocess, we have to wait
	  too long for the output otherwise.

	* command/sam.pm:
	  Also remove .*.gnu.depend files.

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full.xml:
	  Do not run samwise, it is not ready for prime time yet.
	  Use the file_manipulation command to lock the build directory,
	  we do not want more than one build running at a time.
	  Run a realclean target before compiling, use -j 2 to speed up
	  the build.

Fri Dec  7 19:36:12 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* autobuild.pl:
	* command/create_config.pm:
	  Add new command to generate config.h and platform_macros.GNU
	  files.  This new command allow us to keep the complete
	  configuration in a single file.  Still under development, I
	  don't like the current interface.

	* common/simpleparser.pm:
	  Changed name of the XML tags to match autobuild.pl name.

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full.xml:
	  Use the create_config command.

Fri Dec  7 15:21:57 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* README:
	  Documentation

	* autobuild.pl:
	  A script to automatically download, compile and test a module.

	* make_pretty.pl:
	  A script to format the output of a Win32 or Unix build in HTML.
	  Also extracts a summary of the problems detected, if any.

	* scoreboard.pl:
	  A script to download multiple build results from several sites
	  and hosts and show them in a single web page.

	* command/cvs.pm:
	* command/make.pm:
	* command/sam.pm:
	* command/printaceconfig.pm:
	  Modules to implement the stages in the autobuild.pl script.

	* common/simpleparser.pm:
	  A simple parser for XML files.

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full.xml:
	  autobuild.pl configuration for the Full build on
	  sirion.ece.uci.edu

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.lst:
	  scoreboard.pl configuration for the ACE+TAO builds.

	* win32sandbox/ReadMe.txt:
	* win32sandbox/StdAfx.cpp:
	* win32sandbox/StdAfx.h:
	* win32sandbox/sandbox.cpp:
	* win32sandbox/sandbox.dsp:
	* win32sandbox/sandbox.dsw:
	  A wrapper to run tests under tighter control, it avoids popups
	  when exceptions or faults are detected.  It also can limit the
	  total time spent by the test or its children.

	* posixsandbox/sandbox.cpp:
	  Like the previous one, but for POSIX platforms.  Unfortunately
	  ACE breaks havoc with process groups, so it does not work all
	  that great.
