        * configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
          Added Cygwin GCC 32 build

Thu Dec 19 18:43:51 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * configs/autobuild/riverace/hope_dev_vc7_debug.xml: Fix the PATH
          to find devenv with (add missing \). Added configs variable, set
          to Win32.

Thu Dec 19 20:41:12 UTC 2002  Johnny Willemsen <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/BCB5StaticDebug.xml:

          Takes mwc options.

        * command/vc7make.pm:
        * command/wincemake.pm: New commands to build using Visual Studio.NET
          (aka VC7) and Microsoft Embedded Visual C++ 3 and 4, respectively.
          These take advantage of the Visual Studio's ability to build
          according to workspace-defined dependencies (that can be inserted
          with mwc). The plan is to expand them to walk a directory tree
          looking for files, but that's blue sky at this point.

        * autobuild.pl: Added generate_workspace, vc7make, and wincemake to
          the commands list.

        * configs/autobuild/riverace/hope_dev_vc7_debug.xml: Updated to use the
          new generate_workspace and vc7make commands, and to run the built
          tests.

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full_new.xml: Added -config SSL to run
	  the SSLIOP tests. We have been long kidding ourselves that the
	  SSL tests have been run daily! What a joke! They havent been run
	  from the point they moved to the new scoreboard.

Tue Dec 17 21:43:51 2002  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * command/generate_makefile.pm: New command, generate_makefile. Takes
          options="mpc options and dirs" dirs is a comma-separated list of
          directories under $root in which to run mpc with the options
          (after removing the dirs). If no dirs are specified, then some
          file(s) should be included in the mpc options. Everything starts
          based at $root.

        * autobuild.pl: Added generate_makefile to the commands list.
          When doing environment prefix or suffix setting, add the appropriate
          path item separator between the added piece and the existing value.

        * configs/autobuild/riverace/hope_dev_vc7_debug.xml: New for a WinXP
          build with VC 7 (aka VC .NET).

Mon Dec 16 11:23:33 2002  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:

	 Add a new command, print_os_version, which prints some information
	 about the OS version of the build host.  Output configuration
	 information such as compiler and OS version to a new file, _Config.html.
	 This should make retrieving the config information from the web
	 faster.  The current method requires the user to download the
	 entire processed build log file (which takes a long time)
	 in order to view the build config info.

Sun Oct 20 09:24:29 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/tango/Debian_Noinline.xml: Removed -j 2 for
	  realclean.

Sun Oct 20 09:14:23 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: Renamed the Redhat_Core build as
	  Redhat_Static_Core build.

Sun Oct 20 09:10:03 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/Core.xml: Made the following
	  changes.

	  . This build shold not run tests. This is supposed to be a core
	    build.

	  . This build will be a static core build.

	  Our builds have to be used effectively to test various
	  configurations. No point in falling a victim for DRY.

Sat Oct 19 13:38:42 2002  Frank Hunleth <frank@hunleth.com>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
	  Shuffled the TRU 64 build down to the bottom to see whether
          that causes the OpenBSD and XML builds to show up.  The "-"
          change below didn't change anything (not too surprising).

Sat Oct 19 12:32:09 2002  Frank Hunleth <frank@hunleth.com>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
          Removed extraneous "-" in comment that seems to prevent
          the OpenBSD and XML builds from showing up.

Sat Oct 19 11:23:24 2002  Frank Hunleth <frank@hunleth.com>

	* configs/autobuild/slytherin/OpenBSD_Core.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/slytherin/driver.sh:
	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
          Added OpenBSD Core build.

Fri Oct 18 20:50:58 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: Removed TRU 64 from the
	  scoreboard for the timebeing.

Fri Oct 18 01:04:49 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/danzon/CROSS_COMPILE_TAO_IDL.xml:
	  Fix invocations of "make clean" so that they actually work.

Thu Oct 17 12:16:31 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@isis-server.isis.vanderbilt.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/rumba/Debian_WChar.xml: Removed
	  threads=0. This build shold not do many many things. Just do one
	  thing that needs testing.

Mon Oct 14 00:36:05 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/doc/auto_doxygen.pl: Added.
	* configs/autobuild/doc/Doxygen.xml: Use auto_doxygen.pl which is in
	  CVS.

Wed Oct  9 15:24:23 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* common/prettify.pm: Don't highlight extraneous recursive make
	  error messages.

Tue Oct  8 15:19:22 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* common/prettify.pm: Add GNU ld's ": cannot find" to list of
	  error messages to highlight.

Sat Oct  5 12:31:21 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/scoreboard/doc.sh: Update from cvs before building the
	  scoreboard.  Specify output directory for html files.

Fri Oct  4 05:50:08 UTC 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
          Build pc1 is online again, so readded the 3 bcb6 builds.

Thu Oct  3 14:56:08 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* command/process_logs.pm: Reduce amount of kept logs from 20 to 10
	  to reduce disk utilization ( Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> ).
	* common/prettify.pm: Add additional check before splicing error_text
	  array, to eliminate Perl 5.8 warning.

Wed Oct  2 11:26:33  Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* configs/scoreboard/doc.sh:

	  Recreated missing shell driver file.  It was accidentally erased
	  when clearing up diskspace.  For some reason, it was never
	  committed to the CVS repository!

Wed Oct  2 14:48:43 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* common/prettify.pm: Cut down error messages sent in e-mail
	  notification.  Correct some wording in e-mail notification.

Wed Oct  2 14:26:12 UTC 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
          Added BCB6 Pro Unicode build.

        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/BCB6DynamicDebugUnicodeMbg.xml:
          On the build pc3 a complete BCB build takes about 1.5 hours,
          only ace with tests/examples 15 minutes so added another build
          on this pc.

Wed Oct  2 12:01:12 UTC 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
          Added BCB6 Pro build

        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/dobuildpc3.bat:
        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/driverbuildpc3.bat:
        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/BCB6DynamicDebugMbg.xml:
          Added new XML config file for a new build pc we are running
          at our location in Maarsbergen, The Netherlands. This test
          server will run builds only at night.

Wed Oct  2 02:58:36 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* command/process_logs.pm: Remove extraneous print statement.

Wed Oct  2 00:49:10 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* autobuild.pl: Make $verbose a global variable with 'our' keyword.
	* command/file_manipulation.pm:
	* command/log.pm:
	* command/process_logs.pm:
	* command/status.pm:
	  Remove extraneous print statements.
	  Check $main::verbose before printing a few other
	  messages.  This should prevent unnecessary messages
	  from being emitted when autobuild is run as a cron job.

Tue Sep 24 03:27:13 UTC 2002  Don Hinton  <dhinton@ieee.org>

	* configs/autobuild/rumba/Debian_WChar.xml: Added ST to
	  the configs variable so that only single threaded
	  tests would be run.

Tue Sep 17 14:51:20 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: Add SunOS 5.8/Sun CC 5.4 build
	  maintained by Don Hinton <dhinton@objectsciences.com> .

Mon Sep 16 13:58:05 2002 Stephen Torri <storri@cs.wustl.edu>

	* scoreboard.pl:

	  Added a check to eliminate perl warning generate at
	  line 119. If latest.txt was not in the target directory
	  then $latest would be undefined. This caused a perl
	  warning for the conditional.

Sat Sep 14 21:32:43 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/danzon/CROSS_COMPILE_TAO_IDL.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/danzon/SunOS_SunCC53.xml:
	  Check for the .disable file before turning on logging.
	  Thanks to Don Hinton <dhinton@objectsciences.com>.

Fri Sep 13 22:44:39 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/danzon/CROSS_COMPILE_TAO_IDL.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/danzon/SunOS_SunCC53.xml:
	  Danzon was upgraded to Solaris 2.8, so switch config files in build
	  to Solaris 2.8

	* command/make.pm: Don't quit if we cannot chdir() to $project_root.

	* common/prettify.pm:
	  Enhanced e-mail notification capability:
	   - put the error messages in the e-mail
	   - do a cvs diff on $ACE_ROOT/ChangeLog and $TAO_ROOT/ChangeLog in the
	     past 24 hours.

Thu Sep 12 05:47:12 UTC 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
          Removed the BCB6 builds we run at remedy.nl. The pc running the
          builds was needed for an external programmer that is doing a
          delivery. It will be offline a number of weeks.

Thu Sep 12 00:16:15 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/danzon/driver.sh: Put directory with newer
	  GNU utilities in PATH.

Tue Sep 10 10:32:45 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/maglor/Static.xml: Do not send the mail to the
	  devo_group. Just send the mail to bugzilla account!

Mon Sep  3 15:27:22 2002 Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/valinor/Full.xml (PLATFORM_TK_LIBS):

	  Added the Tk library to the list of necessary Tcl/Tk libraries.
	  Fixes a link-time failure in the build.

Tue Sep  3 22:07:42 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/curufin/driver.sh:
	* configs/autobuild/curufin/SingleThreaded.xml: Minor fixes.

Mon Aug 29 15:20:11 2002 Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/valinor/Full.xml:

	  Zapped "-fstack-check" option from CCFLAGS until we get a better
	  understanding of its utility.

	  Reenabled optimization with "-O" flag instead of the "-O3"
	  flag.  No need to go all out for an automated build.

Mon Aug 26 12:02:11 2002 Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/valinor/Full.xml:

	  Disable optimization, debugging and inlining to conserve space.

	  (CCFLAGS):

	  Added "-fstack-check" option to make g++ generate code that
	  causes the OS verify stack boundaries are not crossed.  Useful
	  for multi-threaded code.  Generally not needed for
	  single-threaded code.  This is a sanity check.

Mon Aug 26 16:56:23 2002 Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/valinor/Full.xml:

	  Disabled FL and QT reactors.  I was unable to get them to link.
	  We'll have to figure out why not.

	  Added "-lXm" to the PLATFORM_XT_LIBS make variable.  The Motif
	  library is apparently required for the ACE XtReactor_Test.

Mon Aug 26 10:51:57 2002 Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/valinor/Full.xml:

	  Fixed FL, TK and QT include path problems.

Mon Aug 26 10:40:23 2002 Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/valinor/Full.xml:

	  Fixed include path problem for <linux/eventpoll.h> header.

Mon Aug 26 10:13:37 2002 Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:

	  Added "valinor_Full_Reactors" build.

Mon Aug 26 10:11:17 2002 Ossama Othman  <ossama@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/valinor/Full.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/valinor/driver.xml:

	  New "full" build that enables all reactors, including the
	  Dev_Poll_Reactor, but excluding the WFMO_Reactor.  Native
	  exceptions are disabled.  GNU g++ 3.2 is used.

Mon Aug 26 16:24:47 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* autobuild.pl: Change occurences of things like:
          " %command_table->{$command}" to "$command_table{$command}"
	  to remove Perl 5.8 warning messages:
	  "Using a hash as a reference is deprecated".
	  Thanks to Carlos <coryan@atdesk.com> for the Perl wisdom.

Thu Aug 22 18:06:41 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: Add RedHat_Static build.
	  Throughput and footprint measurements and statistics are
	  gathered from this build.

Thu Aug 22 04:25:48 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/maglor/Static.xml: Add a Linux static build
	  which generates statistics for TAO performance and
	  footprint.

Mon Aug 21 13:25:17 2002 Stephen Torri <storri@cs.wustl.edu>

        * scoreboard.pl:

          Added four new options for builds; PDF, PS, HTML and
          SNAPSHOT. nORB project creates the documentation via
          doxygen in pdf, ps and html format. It also uses
          automake/autoconf to create a snapshot of the distribution.

        * common/prettify.pm:

          Correct false positive when functions include the
          word 'error' in the name. (Fixed by kitty)

Sun Aug 18 15:53:19 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: Added this new build in place of
	  Sirion_Full build.

Sun Aug 18 15:36:00 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full_new.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/sirion/driver_new.sh: Files for a new
	  workspace. The old workspace seems busted with some bizzare
	  problem.

Sun Aug 18 15:23:39 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/balar/Debian_Minimum.xml: Made the realclean
	  without -j 2 option.

Sat Aug 17 08:33:20 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full.xml: Made the realclean without -j
	  2 option.

Fri Aug 16 13:51:14 2002  Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/nirvana/XML_Debug.xml: Added a new build to
	  test out ACE_HAS_XML_SVC_CONF.  The XML parser was broken a
	  while back and we didn't even notice that.  Hopefully, this
	  build will help catch the problem.

Fri Aug 16 12:16:14 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: Change RedHat_GCC_3.1.1 build
	  to RedHat_GCC_3.2.

Sun Aug 11 21:52:20 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* common/mail.pm: First cut at e-mail notification support under Windows,
	  using the Perl Net::SMTP module included with ActiveState Perl.
	* README: Document MAIL_ADMIN_SMTP_HOST variable.

Sun Aug 11 17:08:28 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* common/prettify.pm: Fix wording in e-mail notification.

Fri Aug  9 18:21:43 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* scoreboard.pl: Implement a no-op main::GetVariable() to work around
	  some problems introduced by new features in prettify.pm.

Thu Aug  8 20:08:44 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: Add Debian_Core build.

Thu Aug  8 19:20:22 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/balar/Debian_Core.xml:
	  Remove auto_run_tests command.  This build just builds the core
	  of ACE, gperf, TAO, TAO_IDL, and orbsvcs.  No tests are built.

Thu Aug  8 16:02:59 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/balar/Debian_Core.xml: Added.

Thu Aug  8 15:01:40 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* autobuild.pl:
	   - Put the name of the file being parsed in the variable
	     BUILD_CONFIG_FILE
	   - "use diagnostics" to increase helpfulness of Perl error messages
	   - add "require common::mail"

	* command/make.pm:
	   - Check the return status after invoking make.  A return status
	     of 0 indicates success.  A non-zero return status indicates failure.
	   - Upon make failure, print an easily parseable message:
	     [BUILD ERROR detected in {directory}].  This is makes it easier
	     to determine the occurrence of a build failure when parsing
	     the build logs.

	* command/printaceconfig.pm:
	   - Try looking in the ACE_ROOT environment variable for the
	     ACE root directory before looking in the project_root Perl
	     variable.  This makes it easier to use the autobuild scripts
	     to build projects which *use* ACE, but are not *building* ACE.

	* common/prettify.pm:
	   - Create an array named BUILD_ERROR_COUNTER.  While parsing the
	     build log, every time we detect [BUILD error detected in {directory}],
	     add the directory to the BUILD_ERROR_COUNTER array.
	   - After parsing the build log, look for the MAIL_ADMIN variable
	     which is defined in the XML config file.  If MAIL_ADMIN is
	     defined, and if we have more than 0 items in the BUILD_ERROR_COUNTER
	     array, then send an e-mail notification to the MAIL_ADMIN
	     address with a list of directories where build errors were detected.

	* common/mail.pm:
	   - Preliminary e-mail notification support.  Look for a mail program
	     that supports the "-s Subject" flag, either mail or mailx.
	   - Send an e-mail message.
	   - Unix only supported now.  NT support on the way soon.

	* README: Add little info on e-mail notification.

Wed Aug  7 19:56:57 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/BCB5StaticDebug.xml:
          Added an extra shell command to remove the old log files from the
          charange server.

Tue Aug  6 17:38:57 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/rumba/Debian_GCC_3.0.4.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/rumba/Debian_WChar.xml: Removed the "-j 2" for
	  realclean.

Tue Aug  6 17:30:46 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/danzon/SunOS_SunCC53.xml: Reeanbled exceptions
	  in this build since the problem with SunOS 53 has been fixed by
	  adding new patches.

Sat Aug  3 18:11:14 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/ringil/Legacy.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/ringil/Unicode.xml: Fixes to use the
	  msvc_auto_compile.pl properly.

Sat Aug  3 16:15:06 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/autobuild/ace/LYNX_PPC.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/danzon/CROSS_COMPILE_TAO_IDL.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/danzon/driver_cross_compile_tao_idl.sh:
	  Add psdl_tao binary to the Lynx cross compile build.
	  The Lynx build was trying to execute the Lynx-compiled psdl_tao
	  on Solaris, which is bad.

Fri Aug  2 20:28:44 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: Change scoreboard name to RedHat_GCC_3.1.1
	  to reflect use of new compiler version.

Thu Aug  1 09:03:21 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/ringil/Legacy.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/ringil/Unicode.xml: These builds were using
	  the pippen script. They now use the msvc_auto_compile.pl script!

Thu Aug 01 07:49:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
          Added BCB6 Dynamic Release build.

        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/BCB6DynamicRelease.xml:
          Added shell command to upload logfiles.

Tue Jul 30 13:38:47 2002  Jaiganesh Balasubramanian  <jai@doc.ece.uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/danzon/SunOS_SunCC53.xml:
	  Changed the settings for exceptions from 1 to 0.

Mon Jul 29 23:54:20 UTC 2002  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* configs/scoreboard/doc/acetao.xml: Added Doxygen build.
	* configs/autobuild/doc/driver.sh: Added.
	* configs/autobuild/doc/Doxygen.xml: Added. First cut at a doxygen autobuild.

Mon Jul 29 16:25:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: Added BCB6 Unicode build

        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/MingWGCC31.XML:
          Added first version of XML config file for MingW build using the
          MingW GCC 3.1 compiler.

Mon Jul 29 08:12:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/*.XML:
          Improved settings for the builds and added a unicode build

        * configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: The BCB6 builds are running now
          on NT4 and not on XP.

Sat Jul 27 14:48:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/autobuild/tao/Borland.xml:
          When doing a build from the TAO directory, it must do an all
          build and not only a nightlybuild. The nightlybuild in the TAO
          directory doesn't build ACE. Also use an environment variable
          DEBUG instead of using -DDEBUG=1 twice, this makes maintenance
          easier.

Fri Jul 26 14:10:54 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/beguine/Redhat_Explicit_Templates.xml: Changed
	  some options in the build setup since they dont make much sense
	  for the linux environment in which this build runs.

Fri Jul 26 13:24:12 2002  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/*.XML:
          Improved environment variables and settings for the builds

        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/dobuildpc1.bat:
        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/dobuildpc2.bat:
        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/driverbuildpc1.bat:
        * configs/autobuild/remedynl/driverbuildpc2.bat:
          Added these batch files. The scheduling of time triggered tasks
          on our WinNT4 boxes isn't stable and really good fail safe.
          Because the boxes only do builds I have added these batch files.
          The driverbuildpc# batch files start the correct builds, the
          dobuildpc# batch file trigger the build batch file. This way we
          can easily upgrade the driverbuildpc# batch file and when all
          builds are ready, the cvs update will automatically use the new
          build settings. This also gives us the change to do much more
          different builds on build pc1 because it has at least 20 hours of
          compile time left.

Thu Jul 25 22:56:13 2002  Balachandran Natarajan  <bala@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml: Added the new build to the
	  scoreboard. Removed the build on toutatis since they are not
	  running anyway.

	* configs/autobuild/beguine/driver_explicit.sh:
	* configs/autobuild/beguine/Redhat_Explicit_Templates.xml: Yest
	  another build on beguine.

2002-07-25  Craig Rodrigues  <crodrigu@bbn.com>

	* command/printaceconfig.pm: Print the contents of
	  $ACE_ROOT/VERSION and $TAO_ROOT/VERSION.  This is useful
	  when using the autobuild scripts to build a project
	  which uses ACE/TAO, but is not ACE/TAO itself.

2002-07-24  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * configs/scoreboard/acetao.xml:
          Improved the name of the doc group borland build. It is running

          before invoking make.  Needed for Borland make, which does not support
	  GNU make's -C option.
	* command/printaceconfig.pm: In addition to the root environment variable,
	  try looking in $ACE_ROOT when printing out the ACE configuration.
	  This allows the printaceconfig.pm module to be used on projects
	  which want to print the ACE configuration, but not build ACE itself.

2002-07-11    Nanbor Wang  <nanbor@cs.wustl.edu>

	  how to run egd for that. My guess is that it should be started
	  in driver.sh. Once this build settles down will do that.

	* configs/autobuild/danzon/driver.sh: Changed the compiler that

Fri Dec 14 11:16:12 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* make_pretty.pl (makefile_compiler_output):
	  In print_summary(): use $_ only if it is defined.

Wed Dec 12 17:31:19 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/driver.sh:
	  Changed the build to use gcc-3.0.2 because the compiler on this
	  platform is busted.

Wed Dec 12 16:03:35 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/driver.sh:
	  Fixed -i options.

Wed Dec 12 09:27:49 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* command/log.pm:
	  Remove unused access to a variable.

	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/Core.xml:
	* configs/autobuild/maedhros/driver.sh:
	  Add configuration files for a Core build on maedhros.ece.uci.edu

Tue Dec 11 11:05:16 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* command/make.pm:
	  Use open() instead of `` to run the subprocess, we have to wait
	  too long for the output otherwise.

	* command/sam.pm:
	  Also remove .*.gnu.depend files.

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full.xml:
	  Do not run samwise, it is not ready for prime time yet.
	  Use the file_manipulation command to lock the build directory,
	  we do not want more than one build running at a time.
	  Run a realclean target before compiling, use -j 2 to speed up
	  the build.

Fri Dec  7 19:36:12 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* autobuild.pl:
	* command/create_config.pm:
	  Add new command to generate config.h and platform_macros.GNU
	  files.  This new command allow us to keep the complete
	  configuration in a single file.  Still under development, I
	  don't like the current interface.

	* common/simpleparser.pm:
	  Changed name of the XML tags to match autobuild.pl name.

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full.xml:
	  Use the create_config command.

Fri Dec  7 15:21:57 2001  Carlos O'Ryan  <coryan@uci.edu>

	* README:
	  Documentation

	* autobuild.pl:
	  A script to automatically download, compile and test a module.

	* make_pretty.pl:
	  A script to format the output of a Win32 or Unix build in HTML.
	  Also extracts a summary of the problems detected, if any.

	* scoreboard.pl:
	  A script to download multiple build results from several sites
	  and hosts and show them in a single web page.

	* command/cvs.pm:
	* command/make.pm:
	* command/sam.pm:
	* command/printaceconfig.pm:
	  Modules to implement the stages in the autobuild.pl script.

	* common/simpleparser.pm:
	  A simple parser for XML files.

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full.xml:
	  autobuild.pl configuration for the Full build on
	  sirion.ece.uci.edu

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.lst:
	  scoreboard.pl configuration for the ACE+TAO builds.

	* win32sandbox/ReadMe.txt:
	* win32sandbox/StdAfx.cpp:
	* win32sandbox/StdAfx.h:
	* win32sandbox/sandbox.cpp:
	* win32sandbox/sandbox.dsp:
	* win32sandbox/sandbox.dsw:
	  A wrapper to run tests under tighter control, it avoids popups
	  when exceptions or faults are detected.  It also can limit the
	  total time spent by the test or its children.

	* posixsandbox/sandbox.cpp:
	  Like the previous one, but for POSIX platforms.  Unfortunately
	  ACE breaks havoc with process groups, so it does not work all
	  that great.
