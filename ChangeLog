	* autobuild.pl:
	* command/create_config.pm:
	  Add new command to generate config.h and platform_macros.GNU
	  files.  This new command allow us to keep the complete
	  configuration in a single file.  Still under development, I
	  don't like the current interface.

	* common/simpleparser.pm:
	  Changed name of the XML tags to match autobuild.pl name.

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full.xml:
	  Use the create_config command.

	* README:
	  Documentation

	* autobuild.pl:
	  A script to automatically download, compile and test a module.

	* make_pretty.pl:
	  A script to format the output of a Win32 or Unix build in HTML.
	  Also extracts a summary of the problems detected, if any.

	* scoreboard.pl:
	  A script to download multiple build results from several sites
	  and hosts and show them in a single web page.

	* command/cvs.pm:
	* command/make.pm:
	* command/sam.pm:
	* command/printaceconfig.pm:
	  Modules to implement the stages in the autobuild.pl script.

	* common/simpleparser.pm:
	  A simple parser for XML files.

	* configs/autobuild/sirion/Full.xml:
	  autobuild.pl configuration for the Full build on
	  sirion.ece.uci.edu

	* configs/scoreboard/acetao.lst:
	  scoreboard.pl configuration for the ACE+TAO builds.

	* win32sandbox/ReadMe.txt:
	* win32sandbox/StdAfx.cpp:
	* win32sandbox/StdAfx.h:
	* win32sandbox/sandbox.cpp:
	* win32sandbox/sandbox.dsp:
	* win32sandbox/sandbox.dsw:
	  A wrapper to run tests under tighter control, it avoids popups
	  when exceptions or faults are detected.  It also can limit the
	  total time spent by the test or its children.

	* posixsandbox/sandbox.cpp:
	  Like the previous one, but for POSIX platforms.  Unfortunately
	  ACE breaks havoc with process groups, so it does not work all
	  that great.
