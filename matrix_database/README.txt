This README file is intended to give the basic setup of a builds database.
  As of the time of writing, there were no queries written for generating the html matrix pages.


System Requirements:

    Python
    ~    version 2.2
    ~    http://www.python.org/

    MySQL  (database)
    ~    version 4.1.x
    ~    http://www.mysql.com/

    MySQL for Python  (Python module on machine running the db scripts)
    ~    version 1.0.0
    ~    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python

    mx Extensions for Python  (Python module on machine running the db scripts)
    ~    version  base-2.0.5-py2.2_1
    ~    http://www.egenix.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html


Configure the database connection settings:

    modify matrix_database/DBConfig.py >
        DBConfig
            hostname - machine hosting the database
            dbname - name of the database where you are storing the statistics
            username - database user that will be modifying the database
            password - password of the database user
        DBFileConfig
            dbdir_w - directory where the test matrix generated database files will go 
        CompilationDBFileConfig
            dbdir_w - directory where the build matrix generated database files will go.
                      This is NOT being used currently.  The current place to specify this
                      is in the buildmatrix/buildmatrix.pl file.
        BuildConfig
            config - defines the nightly builds stored in the database.  Each nightly build 
                     should have a defined configuration.  The config should be added BEFORE
                     a running of the build is added to the database.  If the running of the
                     build was added before the config was modified then the "build" table
                     will have to be manually updated with the information.


Create the database: 

    run `python CreateDBTables.py dbname`
        dbname should be the same as the dbname variable in DBConfig class in DBConfig.py


Creating Test Matrix db files:

    make the first command line option to GenerateTestMatrix the number one "1" instead of 0
    e.g. python GenerateTestMatrix.py 1 test_spread.raw /my/builds/scoreboard tests


Creating Build Matrix db files:

    Add the number one "1" as the final command line parameter
    e.g. perl buildmatrix.pl /autobuild/configs/scoreboard/ace.xml /my/builds/scoreboard 1


Removing and Listing Test Matrix db files:

    modify and run matrix_database/RemoveAndListTestDbFiles.sh >
        DB_FILE_DIR - directory holding the db files.


Removing and Listing Build Matrix db files:

    modify and run matrix_database/RemoveAndListCompilationDbFiles.sh >
        DB_FILE_DIR - directory holding the db files.


Adding Test Matrix db files to the Database:

    remote files -
        modify and then run matrix_database/GetAndInsertRemoteTestDbFiles.sh >
            DATABASE_NAME - name of the database where you are storing the statistics
            WEBSERVER - remote machine that has the files generated by GenerateTestMatrix.py
            WEBDIR - webserver directory where the files are stored on the remote machine.
                     The directory used in a URL.
            SCRIPT_DIRECTORY - full path to the matrix_database directory 

    local files -
        modify and then run matrix_database/InsertLocalTestDbFiles.sh >
            DATABASE_NAME - name of the database where you are storing the statistics
            DB_FILE_DIR - directory where the files are being stored locally
            SCRIPT_DIRECTORY - full path to the matrix_database directory
            REMOTE_FILE_LIST - list of files available to be put into the database


Adding Build Matrix db files to the Database:

    remote files -
        modify and then run matrix_database/GetAndInsertRemoteCompilationDbFiles.sh >
            DATABASE_NAME - name of the database where you are storing the statistics
            WEBSERVER - remote machine that has the files generated by GenerateTestMatrix.py
            WEBDIR - webserver directory where the files are stored on the remote machine.
                     The directory used in a URL.
            SCRIPT_DIRECTORY - full path to the matrix_database directory 

    local files -
        modify and then run matrix_database/InsertLocalCompilationDbFiles.sh >
            DATABASE_NAME - name of the database where you are storing the statistics
            DB_FILE_DIR - directory where the files are being stored locally
            SCRIPT_DIRECTORY - full path to the matrix_database directory
            REMOTE_FILE_LIST - list of files available to be put into the database


Adding Test Matrix information directly to the Database:

    make the first command line option to GenerateTestMatrix the number two "2"
    Add the name of the database as the final parameter
    e.g. python GenerateTestMatrix.py 2 test_spread.raw /my/builds/scoreboard tests BuildDB


Adding Build Matrix information directly to the Database:

    Not Implemented.
