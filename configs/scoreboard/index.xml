You have reached the logically existing, virtual ACE+TAO+CIAO+DAnCE
scoreboard.  It shows all the OS/compiler combinations ACE+TAO+CIAO+DANCE are
tested against everyday, all over the world.  We have builds running
continuously at
<a href="https://www.remedy.nl/">Remedy IT</a>,
<a href="http://www.riverace.com/">Riverace Corporation</a>,
<a href="http://www.microfocus.com/products/corba/index.aspx">Micro Focus</a>,
<a href="http://www.ociweb.com/">Object Computing Inc</a>.
<p>
The distributed scoreboard is divided into following categories:
<li>ACE Builds for Release [<a href="./ace.html">regular</a>|<a href="ace.rss">rss</a>]</li>
<li>ACE Builds for Future Release [<a href="./ace_future.html">regular</a>]</li>

In addition to the build results found in the Scoreboard described
above, a number of other ACE/TAO/CIAO/DAnCE development process related web
pages we use are the following:
<ul>
<li>
  <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/1">Coverity Scan for Static Analysis and Test Coverage</a>

The <i>Coverity Scan</i> pages illustrate which areas of
ACE+TAO+CIAO+DAnCE code are used, and how frequently.
