You have reached the logically existing, virtual Facet scoreboard.
It shows all the OS/compiler  combinations that Facet are tested against
everyday, all over the world.  We have builds running continuously at 
Washington University, St. Louis.
<p>
The distributed scoreboard is divided into following five
categories: 
<li><a href="./facet.html"> Facet Builds</a></li>
<li><a href="./tao-facet-adapter.html"> TAO-Facet-Adapter</a> </li>
</p>

<p>

If you'd like to contribute builds to our virtual
scoreboard <a href="mailto:djc2@cs.wustl.edu">please contact us</a>
and let us know which platform combinations you can
contribute. Instructions for setting up your own daily build and
scoreboard are
