SSH to the root account on the device, default password is 'alpine'.  First SSH attempt will take some time, as the device needs to generate keys.

To get perl, ssh in to the device, and

wget http://coredev.nl/cydia/coredev.pub
apt-key add coredev.pub
echo 'deb http://coredev.nl/cydia iphone main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/coredev.nl.list
