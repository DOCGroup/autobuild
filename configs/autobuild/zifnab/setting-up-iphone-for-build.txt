Jailbreak the device.  Install the following from Cydia:

openssh
insomnia (to keep from going to sleep)
apt packages
wget
rsync

To get perl, ssh in to the device, and

wget http://coredev.nl/cydia/coredev.pub
apt-key add coredev.pub
echo 'deb http://coredev.nl/cydia iphone main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/coredev.nl.list

now relaunch cydia, and perl will be available for install.
