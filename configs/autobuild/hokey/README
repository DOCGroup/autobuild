Readme for using autobuild/scoreboard with facet and ace-tao-facet-adapter

-----------------


Overview
--------

Currently we're running several different autobuilds on hokey. They
include (but aren't limited to) Real Time Java (javart), facet (using
the latest release of ACE+TAO), facet-cvs (using ACE+TAO from cvs),
facet-oep (using ACE+TAO from Boeing's OEP), and jRate. They directory
structure of the ~bugzilla/autobuild/configs/autobuild/hokey works
like this:

-- facet (latest release ACE-5.3+TAO-1.3.tar.gz)
 |
 - facet-cvs (ACE+TAO from cvs)
 |
 - facet-oep (ACE+TAO from the cvs version Boeing's OEP /home/hokey/OEP_B2_4)

There are also files for supporting jRate and javart (but since they
had significantly less files than the facet stuff I didn't bother
putting them in separate dirs) 


setenv CVSROOT cvs.doc.wustl.edu:/project/cvs-repository
bugzilla@hokey autobuild/hokey/facet> setenv CVS_RSH ssh


Facet
-----

Setting up autobuild for facet wasn't quite as easy as anticipated.

I had to do the following things to get it to build properly.

1) Facet requires ACE_Wrappers to be handy to build, but facet
   builds first, then ACE, so I had to manually check out 
   RTEvent/facet
   RTEvent/tao-facet-adapter
   ACE_Wrappers

   first before running driver.csh to get things going. I could have 
   (maybe) order the cvs checkouts funny or put them into separate
   xml files, but one manual checkout seemed the easiest way.

2) Facet requires platform_template and facet_template copied to
   platform.properties and facet.properties. Autobuild didn't seem to
   easily support this, so again, I did it by hand. Plus, facet_template
   does not have any 



Building facet from the latest release available
------------------------------------------------

I used this version of ACE+TAO
/project/deuce/ftp/pub/previous_versions/ACE-5.3+TAO-1.3.tar.gz

which is also available on the web from deuce.doc.wustl.edu
