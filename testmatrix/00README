The files in this directory are used for creating html pages
 with statistical information about the builds.

The bash shell script buildMatrix parses the log files and calls
 the python program to generate the html pages.  buildMatrix takes
 2 parameters, the list of builds and the beginning of the name of
 the test matrix page.  The string ".matrix.html" will be appended
 to the name of the page when it is generated.

The python program requires python >= 2.1


Setting up:
  Edit Makefile
   - change the SCOREBOARD_CONFIG_DIR variable to the directory
     that contains the xml configuration file for the scoreboard
   - add the name of the test list to the "all:" target
   - add a test list target (copy an existing list target and
     change the target name)

  Edit update_scoreboard.sh
   - change the log directory variable LOG_DIR to the directory of
     your log directories.  This is the directory below where the
     actual log .html files are.
   - change the TEST_MATRIX_DIR variable to the location of this
     directory.
   - change the BUILD_LIST variable to the name of the file list
     that was added to the Makefile.
   - Change the name of the test matrix generated file
     (TEST_MATRIX)
   - [if necessary] change the 'make' command to have the full
     path to make.
   - [Optional] Uncomment the autobuild command to have the shell
     script run the build.

  Edit buildMatrix
   - change the "logdir" variable to the location of the log files
     on your system.  This is the same value as LOG_DIR in
     update_scoreboard.sh
   - change the path to the python executable [if necessary]

  Edit *.py 
   - change the path to the python executable [if necessary]


Running:
  Run the update_scoreboard.sh script.
