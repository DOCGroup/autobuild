The autobuild directory contains perl modules and scripts that are used to
process the scoreboard XML files.  The scoreboard.pl script creates the html
output that makes up the virtual scoreboard.

Each scoreboard XML file has a <preamble> section that can be used to set up
static information at the top of the scoreboard page.

The <group> section is used to display a set of builds adjacently on the
page.  The group is named via the <name> element.

Within each group, there can be an unlimited number of builds.  Each build
is defined with the <build> element which contains a <name>, a <url>, and an
optional <build_sponsor> and <build_sponsor_url>.  The <url> specifies where
the log files, from the autobuild.pl script, are located.
